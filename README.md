# The Minimalist Journal

This is a project for a minimalist journaling system online. The site is inspired by [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and Are.na in its minimalist aesthetic coupled with good UX


## Status

The project is yet in it's initial stages. I'm currently workin on the main website, and I might add a blog to log the progress as well as gather material for a possible product hunt/kickstarter campaign.

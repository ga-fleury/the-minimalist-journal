After almost a month absent from this project, and contemplating wether svelte was the correct framework to do this (I even started another version using next js) I have decided that a project using whatever framework is better than no project at all. So i decided to get going with my todo list and started implementing que logic behind the square cards (essentially is just a fancy todo list). I'm quite happy with the progress and I'm loving using Svelte.

For my next steps I'd like to save the cards to the users local storage, that way I can send the project to other people as proof of concept. After that I'll need to refine the card by letting the user add parameters to track daily, and eventually I'll need authentication and a database to store the users data.

I'm excited with the next steps!

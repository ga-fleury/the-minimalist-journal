Again it's been a while since I made any sort of progress in this project. But today I decided to solve sign in once and for all. I'm happy to say that google sign in is working as expected. I don't think I'll add another login option for now (or ever for that matter)

The next step (and the one i dread the most) is making a database for the journal and somehow linking it to the users (?). I'm wishing myself luck.

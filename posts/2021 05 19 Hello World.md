## A minimalist journal

without an actual journal. After researching various methods of self-improvement for myself, I inevitably came across various types of journaling systems. And all of them had the same general idea, start small. Whatever you do start small and focus on making it a habit. And that is not a coincidence, this happens becausethe habit is precisely the fundamental part to all of this, even more important than the journal itself.

That's exactly where I had the most problem. Some methods encourage you to buy a big black journal that you fill out everyday and slowly it becomes a great thing that you can look back. Other methods (in the efforts of lowering the effort to entry even more) encourage you to do your jorunaling on whatever you have on hand: post-its, pre-made models for print, etc...
No matter the method, I'd always forget or not log entries on my journal when, for example, I was on a trip and forgot to take my huge black notebook with me. And at that point remembering to bring pen and paper to places was as much as a task that needed to become a habit as the journaling itself.

This is the main reason for this project. Maybe if I can do my journaling in front of my computer (where I already spent the largest part of my day) it can be as effortless as I think it ought to be.
